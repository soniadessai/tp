Decide on the absolute MINIMUM fields for the data model for the first working system. 
An example of the data that the first working version might work with is: 
• id: the id auto-generated by the database  for this record 
• stockTicker: the "ticker" for a stock e.g. AMZN, AAPL, C, NFLX 
• price: the price in USD per stock that this order is requesting to be bought or sold 
• volume: the quantity of stocks that this order is requesting to be bought or sold 
• buyOrSell: a flag indicating whether this is a request to BUY or SELL (a future enhancement might be to use an Enum here) 
• statusCode: an integer code indicating the status of this order. For the initial system this will be set to 0. 
We will enhance this in future weeks so that another component may update this status 
(e.g. a future enhancement may use this to indicate: 0=Pending, 1=Filled, 2=Rejected...)
